  * **Secure PDF Upload & Analysis:** Seamlessly upload PDF legal documents for processing.
  * **AI-Powered Summarization:** Get structured, easy-to-understand summaries tailored to the Indian legal framework.
  * **Interactive Q&A:** Ask specific follow-up questions and receive contextual answers about your document.
  * **Dynamic Keyword Highlighting:** Critical and moderate legal terms are automatically highlighted for quick risk assessment.
  * **Document & History Management:** Securely view, manage, and delete your analyzed documents and see a full timeline of your activity.
  * **Dynamic Model Selection:** Choose between the powerful **Gemini 1.5 Pro** for deep analysis or the fast **Gemini 1.5 Flash** for quick summaries.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technology Stack

  * **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript, `marked.js`
  * **Backend:** Python 3, Flask

## üöÄ How to Run Locally

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

  * Python 3.10+
  * Git
  * A Google Gemini API Key
  * Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Krish2786/LegalMind-AI.git](https://github.com/Krish2786/LegalMind-AI.git)
    cd LegalMind-AI
    ```

2.  **Set up the Backend:**
    Navigate into the `backend` folder and set up your Python environment:
    ```bash
    cd backend

    # Create a Python virtual environment
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate the virtual environment
    # On Windows (PowerShell):
    .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    # On macOS/Linux (Bash/Zsh):
    # source venv/bin/activate

    # Install the required Python packages
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **üîê Configure Environment Variables (CRUCIAL STEP)**
    You need to provide your Google Gemini API key.
      * Create a new file named `.env` inside the `backend` folder.
      * Open the `.env` file and add your Google Gemini API key exactly as shown below:
        ```
        GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key_here"
        ```
        Replace `"your_gemini_api_key_here"` with your actual API key.

4.  **Run the Application:**
    You will need **two separate terminal windows** running simultaneously: one for the backend server and one for the frontend server.

      * **Terminal 1: Start the Backend Server**
        (Ensure you are in the `backend` folder and your `venv` is activated from step 2)
        ```bash
        python app.py
        ```
        The backend will start and typically run on `http://127.0.0.1:5000` or `http://localhost:5000`.

      * **Terminal 2: Start the Frontend Server**
        (Open a **new** terminal window)
        ```bash
        # Navigate to the frontend folder
        cd LegalMind-AI/frontend

        # Start a simple Python HTTP server to serve the frontend files
        python -m http.server 8000
        ```
        The frontend will be served from `http://localhost:8000`.

5.  **Access the Application:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to **`http://localhost:8000`** to interact with LegalMind AI.

## üîÆ Future Plans

  * **Multilingual Support:** Extend analysis and summarization to various Indian languages (e.g., Hindi, Tamil).
  * **Comparative Analysis:** Allow users to upload two documents to have the AI compare them and highlight differences.
  * **Risk Scoring:** Implement a feature to provide a quantitative risk score (e.g., 7.5/10) for a quick assessment of a document's severity.
  * **User Accounts & Authentication:** Implement secure user login and profile management.
  * **Deployment to Cloud:** Deploy the application to a scalable cloud platform for wider accessibility
